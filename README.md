# gr - a playground for graph-related things

There are already quite a few JS libraries that support graph-related things. If I were approaching
this as as development project, I would probably pick one and if it didn't do what I want it to do
simply fix it.

But my goal here is to learn things the hard way, by coding them up. The intent is to have a number
of accompanying modules for this one (which is just about the basic infrastructure) that support
various aspects of graphs that I'm interested in.

If it turns out to be generally useful, great. But the goal is to pick up some fu in this domain.
